# Project-1
I create a program test the typing speed of the user with a basic GUI application using Python language. 
Also, the Random function is used to fetch the random words for the speed testing calculation. Following command is used to install the above-mentioned libraries:
pip install tkintertable
pip install pytest-timeit
Firstly, all the libraries are imported that are installed as mentioned above, and using the bottom-up approach the programming for testing the typing speed using python is created
Then implement the code: from TypingSpeed file
In the above code, I first create the speed testing window using Tkinter. The function is defined for calculating and printing the correct output after the user input. A specific list of words is provided to the user to type and test the speed of typing. For that, we provide a list of words and generate them with the random function.
